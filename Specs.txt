We would like to add a new feature to our PizzaMe application (current version attached). Here is the User Story:

As a PizzaMe user, I want to be able to sort my list of Pizza establishments, so I can find a particular establishment easier.

AC1:  The user should be presented with a method to select how to sort the list.  This selector should be presented to the user above the table of pizza establishment.

AC2:  The selector should allow the user to select to sort by either:  a) location (closest first), or b) alphabetical

AC3:  When the selector is activated by the user, the table will be sorted appropriately.

The code used to implement this feature must be zipped and returned to ————-- for review.  Please make a note of how much time was spent on the development of this feature.  You have as much time as necessary to complete this task.
